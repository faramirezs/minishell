	COMMAND,				// 0 These are the commands we need to create ("echo, cd, pwd, export, unset, env, exit")
	ENV_VAR,				// 1 Environment variable are words that start with $ (e.g., "$HOME", "$USER"), we do error handling for this after the tokenizing and node creation
	ABS_PATH,		   	// 2 A path starting with / (e.g., /directory/directory/  or /directory/file ) is an absolute path and refers to the exact location of the file or command file system staring from root directory
	REL_PATH,		   	// 3 A path that doesnâ€™t start with ./ or ../ It is relative to the current working directory. (example ./directory/directory/  or ../directory/directory/  or ../directory/directory/ or ../directory/file )
	OPTION,		 		// 4 Command options (only "-n" with echo needs to handled), if not "-n" it should be UKNOWN (unless if the -n is bwtween quotes i think)

	REDIR_IN,	   		// 5 Input redirection ("<")
	REDIR_OUT,	  		// 6 Output redirection (">")
	APPEND_OUT,	 		// 7 Append redirection (">>")
	HEREDOC,				// 8 Here-document redirection ("<<")

	PIPE,		   		// 9 Pipe operator ("|")
	STRING_D_QUOTES,		// 10 Strings inside double quotes (e.g., "hello world"), after the string is ready we have to add a function that will see if we have $var inside here because it can be expanded inside double quotes only, we should also have a function that cheks if there is a command token type only inside
	STRING_S_QUOTES,		// 11 String inside single quotes (e.g., "hello world"), after the string is ready we should have a function that cheks if there is a command token type only inside

	WORD,		 			// 12 Any letter or number that is not surrounded in " " and '', after we create the tokens and nodes, we need a function that will see if the word is an external command or just a word
	UNKNOWN,		 		// 13 An invalid token type is a symbol that our shell won't have to execute: "\", ";", "&&", "||", unclosed " and ', "(", ")", "#", "&", "$(...)", `backticks, "*", "~" etc.. --- what about tilde?
	END,					// 14 END token


	// I DON'T THINK WE NEED THESE ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THESE DETAILS ARE PART OF THE INVALID TOKENS CATEGORY OR THINGS WE WILL CHECK AFTER WE PARSE TOKENS TO NODES
	//EXTERNAL_COMMAND	  // commands like grp or ls that we do not have to create, we can access these as binaries in /bin or /usr/bin, we do not need to create tokens for these, after we create our tokens and nodes we will then see if word is a external command
	// D_QUOTE,		 	// we can handle unclosed quotes as an unknown token, we can tokenize closed double quotes strings as STRING_D_QUOTES
	// S_QUOTE,		 	// we can handle unclosed quotes as an unknown token, we can tokenize closed double quotes strings as STRING_D_QUOTES
	// DELIMITER,	  		// we don't hav  to handle ; as a delimiter as it is required by the bonus, the symbol ; be seen as error if not inside a string
	// OPERATOR,	   		// we don't hav  to handle logical operators for `&&` and `||` as they are required by the bonus, these symbols will be seen as an error if not inside a string
	// FILENAME,	   		// i don't think we need this as we will check if something is a file based on the commands we find in our nodes
	// SUBSHELL,	   		// we do not need to handle subshell
	// COMMENT,				// we do not need to handle comments
	// PATH_EXP,			// we do not need this
